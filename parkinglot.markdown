# The practice of balancing rocks

![][54] One of the practices I have cultivated for many years is the art of 
rock balancing. I was initially inspired in this by watching rock balancing**** 
artists along the waterfront in Vancouver in the mid nineties. I was amazed 
at the serene beauty of large rocks balanced at improbable angles.

When I began trying this for myself, I discovered that the practice is deeply 
reflective and highly instructive. It is a calming meditation, inviting rocks 
to find a balance with one another, and it is a lovely metaphor for the leadership 
qualities of facilitating and holding space. Often, as part of the Art of Hosting 
workshops I help teach, I offer [rock balancing**** as a morning practice][55], 
to bring presence and calm to the day ahead.

If you would like to join me for an hour or two of rock balancing**** on Bowen 
Island or elsewhere, please feel free to contact me. I’m always up for play. 
I can also offer short workshops in conferences, gatherings and retreat.

Since 2007 I have begun taking photographs of rocks I have balanced in various 
places to which I have travelled. I invite you to enjoy a slide show of my 
collection at [my flickr gallery.][56]
