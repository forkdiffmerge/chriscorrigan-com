# Welcome

![][54]

I am a process artist, a teacher and a facilitator of social technologies for 
face to face conversation in the service of emergence. My business is supporting 
invitation: the invitation to collaborate, to organize, to find one another 
and make a difference in our communities, organizations and lives.

You can explore my work here:

* [Open Space Technology Resources][13]
* [Facilitation Resources][9]
* [Parking Lot: the weblog][1]

In a changing and complex world, there are no answers, there is no certainty. 
Leadership and questions are everywhere. We are called to be in active engagement 
with the world around us, to make sense of things we are seeing and to act 
on our visions and ideas for the good and benefit of all.

The fundamental human capacities of this era are among the most ancient: invitation 
and conversation. When we invite people to work with us, whoever shows up are 
the right people. When we live a life of invitation, our work becomes about 
making connections to make things happen. And once we have a group of people 
acting on an invitation, deep and meaningful conversation becomes the way we 
collaborate sustainably together to co-create the world we want.

I work with organizations seeking to improve their work, communities seeking 
to improve their future, people looking to improve their lives. I hold and 
care for process – the ways in which we work together – to encourage people 
to make their best possible contributions. I have an unflagging belief that 
the answers and leadership we need arise out of collaboration and conversation. 
By facilitating skillful dialogue, I do my best to hold space for futures to 
emerge.
