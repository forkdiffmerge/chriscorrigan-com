# Music

A large part of my life is dedicated to playing music and especially traditional 
Irish dance music on the wooden flute and guitar. I play and record in British 
Columbia and frequently I appear on Bowen Island, at a variety of venues, festivals, 
coffee houses and events. I also sing both in traditional modes and with an 
Evensong chorale, singing liturgical music.

* [Learn more about the songs and tunes I have made over the years.][12]

I have appeared on a number of recordings of traditional and contemporary music, 
written the soundtrack for a play and had my music used in videos.

Over the years, my music has been broadcast on CiTR (Vancouver), Co-op Radio 
(Vancouver), Trent Radio (Peterborough, Ontario) and the CBC, and has been 
reviewed in fRoots and the Georgia Straight.

Although more of a traditional folk musician, and therefore not focused on 
performance, I have nevertheless appeared on stage at the Rogue Folk Club, 
The Gulf Islands Celtic Music Festival, Endangered Speicies, Steveston Salmon 
Festival, the Princeton Traditional Music Festival, BowFest, Northwest Folklife 
in Seattle and the Vancouver Folk Music Festival among other musical gatherings 
and venues.  On an off I have been active in music scenes in Peterborough, 
Ontairo and Vancouver BC, and currently I perform and play as often as I can 
on my home island of Bowen Island, BC.

I have had the pleasure of performing and recording with many interesting and 
talented musicians over the years. On the Irish and traditional music side 
this includes Randy Vic, Dave Marshall, Amy Stephen, Andy Hillhouse, Mark Roberts, 
Steph Custer, Norah Rendell, Neil Hammond, Keona Hammond, John Bartlett, Ryka 
Ruebsaat, Moritz Behm, Nora Rendell, Dan Compton, and Paul Hawtin. I have also 
played with others from the jazz, folk, rock, classical and world music realms, 
including Julie Vik, Chris Coon, John Bottomley, Shawn Pollinger, Jude Neale, 
Alison Nixon, Pauline LeBel, Buff Allen, Shasta Martinuk and Brian Hoover.

### Instruments

**Flutes and whistles**

I play a six key Hammy Hamilton flute made of African Blackwood and a Casey 
Burns keyless grenadilla flute. I play a bunch of cheap but useful Susato, 
Generation and Walton whistles.

**Guitar**

I have two guitars. My pride and joy is a Larrivee D-03 (88823) made and purchased 
in Vancouver BC in 2006. My old friend is a Yamaha FG-410, which I have had 
since 1982. It’s nothing special, but I worked on it a little in 1986 to lower 
the action (no mean feat without a truss rod, especially when you don’t know 
what you’re doing!) and it has been a good friend for more than 25 years.

**Didgeridoo**

My didgeridoo was made by termites in Northern Australia and purchased in Perth, 
Western Australia.

**Djembe**

I have a djembe made by Yendor from Cortes Island BC. It was passed to me by 
my late father in law Peter Frost.

**Voice**

Courtesy of my parents, who provided the raw material for the vocal cords and 
refined in my youth by singing along with Freddy Mercury for years. They must 
not have felt like that was adequate payback, but it made me a true tenor.
